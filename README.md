This is a game engine written in C++ using Vulkan and is created solely by Cameron Allen. This is very much a work in progress, but the plan is to make it cross-platform, intuitive and lightweight. With a focus on efficiency, I aim to make an exceptional, free game engine whose games can reach as many people as possible.
